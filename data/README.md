#The Data

These `json` files were generated by running the corresponding PDF through the [SalarySchedules.App](https://github.com/thekaveman/SalarySchedules/tree/master/SalarySchedules.App) console app.

##Where is FY 10/11?

Currently, the `json` file for FY 10/11 is unavailable due to a bug (still unknown) in the parser. As time allows, the bug will be resolved and `json` data for FY 10/11 will be made available.

##What Does the Data Look Like?

Each `json` file corresponds to a single fiscal year's salary schedule. A salary schedule is made up of a number of components.
   
###The date the schedule was generated
```javascript
"ReportRunDate": "\/Date(1277449200000)\/"
```

###The fiscal year of the schedule
```javascript
"FiscalYear": {
    "StartDate": "\/Date(1246431600000)\/",
    "EndDate": "\/Date(1277881200000)\/",
    "ShortSpanCode": "09/10"
}
```

###The bargaining units represented in the schedule

An individual bargaining unit is made up of its Code and Name, e.g.
```javascript
{
    "Code": "ATA",
    "Name": "Administrative Team Associates"
}
```

The salary schedule then has an array of bargaining units, e.g.
```javascript
"BargainingUnits": [{
		"Code": "ATA",
		"Name": "Administrative Team Associates"
	},
	{
		"Code": "MTA",
		"Name": "Management Team Associates"
	},
	//etc
]
```

###The job classes represented in the schedule

A job class is composed of a title, code, grade, bargaining unit (from the above array), and one or more steps (up to a maximum of 5).

A step has a number, and the rate broken out by hourly, biweekly, monthly, and annual pay.

```javascript
{
		"Title": "Accountant-Collections",
		"Code": "1109",
		"Grade": "060",
		"BargainingUnit": {
			"Code": "ATA",
			"Name": "Administrative Team Associates"
		},
		"Steps": [{
			"StepNumber": 1,
			"HourlyRate": 29.80,
			"BiWeeklyRate": 2383.85,
			"MonthlyRate": 5165.00,
			"AnnualRate": 61980.00
		}//possibly more, up to 5 total
		]
}
```
